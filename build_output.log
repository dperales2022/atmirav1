./pages/StyledFirebaseAuth.tsx
52:6  Warning: React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'firebaseAuth', 'uiCallback', and 'userSignedIn'. Either include them or remove the dependency array. Outer scope values like 'firebaseui' aren't valid dependencies because mutating them doesn't re-render the component.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

./pages/components/Chartnum1.jsx
20:19  Warning: Assignments to the 'nifaSegur' variable from inside React Hook useEffect will be lost after each render. To preserve the value over time, store it in a useRef Hook and keep the mutable value in the '.current' property. Otherwise, you can move this variable directly inside useEffect.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
72:21  Warning: Assignments to the 'chartInstance' variable from inside React Hook useEffect will be lost after each render. To preserve the value over time, store it in a useRef Hook and keep the mutable value in the '.current' property. Otherwise, you can move this variable directly inside useEffect.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
